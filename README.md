## üîó API Integration

This application consumes data from the following [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/):

- `GET /all`: Retrieve a list of all countries.
- `GET /name/{name}`: Search for a country by name.
- `GET /region/{region}`: Filter countries by region.
- `GET /alpha/{code}`: Fetch full details for a country using its alpha code.

Each country includes essential details:
- **Name**: The country's name.
- **Capital**: The capital city.
- **Population**: The population of the country.
- **Region**: The region the country belongs to.
- **Languages**: The languages spoken in the country.

## üõ†Ô∏è Challenges Faced and How They Were Fixed

### 1. **API Rate Limiting**
   - **Challenge**: While developing the app, we encountered rate-limiting issues with the REST Countries API, especially when making frequent requests for large amounts of data.
   - **Solution**: To manage the rate limits, we implemented caching by storing previously fetched data in `localStorage`. This ensures that repeated requests for the same data are avoided, reducing the number of API calls and speeding up the app's performance.

### 2. **Handling Large Dataset**
   - **Challenge**: Fetching all countries from the `/all` endpoint could result in slow performance, especially when the application was first loading or filtering the data.
   - **Solution**: Implemented lazy loading and pagination techniques to fetch and display data in smaller chunks. This ensures that users get a smooth experience without waiting for a long time for the full list of countries to load.

### 3. **Ensuring Responsive Design**
   - **Challenge**: Initially, the layout of the app did not scale well on mobile devices, which affected the user experience.
   - **Solution**: We switched to **Tailwind CSS** for rapid prototyping and used its built-in responsive design utilities. By adding appropriate breakpoints and optimizing the layout, the app now performs well across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### 4. **Search Functionality with Large Dataset**
   - **Challenge**: The search functionality was slow when dealing with large datasets, especially when users typed rapidly in the search bar.
   - **Solution**: Introduced **debouncing** to delay the API call until the user has stopped typing for a specified amount of time. This minimizes unnecessary calls and improves performance. We also filtered the country names client-side to speed up the search process.
